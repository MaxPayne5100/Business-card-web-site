  <h1>INDEX</h1>
  <p>
  The index page is the URL or local file that automatically loads when a web browser starts and when the browser's 'home' button is pressed. The term is also used to refer to the front page, web server directory index, or main web page of a website of a group, company, organization, or individual.

Make sure you have the index page in your public_html directory, otherwise, your site will not be shown in the browser correctly. When creating your index page, you should use one of the following names (the first one found will be shown if the visitor doesn't specify a page in the URL):

index.html
index.php

You may also specify which file name should be the home page of your website by editing the .htaccess file. You just need to add the following code to the .htaccess file:

DirectoryIndex required_file_name

'required_file_name' should be substituted with the existing file name. If you want to set up a list of these files, please separate them with space symbols.
